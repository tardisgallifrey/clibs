# A collection of C libraries I can use

I am working on a project to increase my ability
to write in C, learn linked lists better, improve my
skills in Neovim, and develop better SDLC understanding.

So, this useless, but necessary project to produce a working
C linkedlist library.

The outcome will be a set of `.so`, shared C libraries that 
facilitate creating linked list nodes, adding nodes to a list, 
removing nodes from a list, finding a node in a list, 
and inserting nodes into a list.

You can gather current ORDER OF MARCH progress in the file: `ORDEROFMARCH.md`.
