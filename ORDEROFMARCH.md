# ORDER OF MARCH FOR THE LINKED LIST PROJECT

1. On 6/20/25, I have completed the first basic shared library.
    Library names are as follows:
    llint -- Linked List for Integers
    lldouble -- Linked List for Doubles
    llchar -- Linked list for char[acters]
    llstring -- Linked list for character arrays
    Libraries are stored in `/home/user/clib/lib`
    library and test file source are in `/home/user/clib/sources/linkedlist`
    There are other README files in other folders, too.
2. TODO: add addAtTailInt(), insertInt(), findNodeInt()
3. TODO: can also start man page production
4. TODO: automate shared library compilation and installation.
